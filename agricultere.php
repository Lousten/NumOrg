                                        potassium or ammonium chloride).</p>
                                    <p><b>Silage</b>– is high-moisture fermented forage, used as food for ruminants. It
                                        undergoes fermentation over approx. 2 weeks from the time it is stored in the
                                        silo. In the process it releases a nitric-bearing corrosive liquid./p>
                                    <p><b>Herbicides and pesticides</b>– often contain copper-bearing fluids. For
                                        example, the “Bordeaux Mixture” is made from copper sulphate, water and lime,
                                        which attacks aluminium and zinc, thereby eroding the protective galvanic layer

                                    <p>Agriculture makes prolific use of steel structures and sheet-metal walls and
                                        partitions. As mentioned above, many agricultural chemical and biological
                                        substances are corrosive. Also, the environment takes its toll, especially in
                                        locations close to the sea or with high ambient humidity. Condensation is always
                                        a problem in humid climates having marked temperature differences between day
                                        and night.</p>
                                    <p>Much of the steel used is galvanised. However, corrosive substances, whether salt
                                        or acidic by-products erode the protective galvanic coating, exposing the
                                        underlying steel to corrosion. For example, in rural inland areas, a galvanised
                                        sheet-steel wall may last over 30 years without preventive maintenance, whereas
                                        in a humid or polluted environment, it would last 5 to 10 years.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, certain soils (sulphate and chloride bearing peats and marshes)
                                        attack structure foundations.</p>
                                    <p> <b>Silos </b> are damaged by organic acids – A very acidic and corrosive
                                        environment prevails in silos containing crop maize silage, which rapidly
                                        ferments, producing acids with a typical concentration in solution of 2% lactic
                                        acid, 0.5% acetic acid, and a pH as low as 3.6.</p>
                                    <p> <b>Dairy farming infrastructure</b> – Milking equipment is generally made of
                                        stainless steel, which has excellent corrosion withstand. However, supporting
                                        structures, made of mild steel, are prone to corrosion by lactic acid- bearing
                                        milk wastes and chlorine-bearing cleaning/sterilisation agents.</p>

                                    <p>Agricultural activity is seasonal, different machines being used in different

                                        activity (or inactivity) does not require their use – especially during cold
                                        humid winters. If they are not thoroughly cleaned before storage, the residue of
                                        the substances they handle will surely cause corrosion over the months.</p>

                                        moisture can accumulate are particularly vulnerable to corrosion. High humidity
                                        (leading to condensation) and poor ventilation of the hangars where machinery is
                                        stored off-season accelerates any corrosion process, sometimes significantly.

                                        1.9 million farms in the USA, and the value of farm machinery and equipment is
                                        estimated to stand at $15 billion annually (1997 census). It was found that the
                                        two principal reasons for replacing machinery and equipment were the upgrade to
                                        more modern equipment and the replacement of worn-out and corroded equipment.
