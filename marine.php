                                        <p>Ships are primarily exposed to atmospheric corrosion, caused by a combination
                                            of high moisture and salt-laden sea spray, both of which directly attack the
                                            steel through the smallest deficiencies of the pain layer.</p>
                                        <p>Ships also suffer from fretting corrosion, caused by the repeated relative
                                            surface motion between loaded metal surfaces, typically induced by vibration
                                            (caused by machinery) and structural flexing (caused by sea currents and
                                            wind).</p>

                                        <p> Like all metal structures containing different metals, at the contact points
                                            between different metals, galvanic corrosion takes place – by the two metals
                                            forming a parasitic galvanic cell with the sea water acting as an
                                            electrolyte. This cell’s action causes one of the metals, typically the
                                            steel to oxidise.</p>

                                        <p> Weak or absent earth connections between a docked ship’s hull and its
                                            pier-side power supply causes leakage earth currents to flow out of the
                                            ship’s hull (typically through a hull protrusion or sharp edge) into the
                                            water, and thereafter to the seabed, which is the harbour power-supply’s
                                            earth. The point at which current leaves the ship’s hull is prone to stray
                                            current corrosion.</p>

                                        <p>The abundance of sea spray causes water to become trapped and accumulate in
                                            crevices, whether formed by silt, sand, marine organisms, structural
                                            recesses, or sealing material. This forms a stagnant always humid area on
                                            the metal, which gives rise to a hidden-from-the-eye corrosion patch, which
                                            gradually erodes the metal and allows water to ingress inner structures.
                                            This is known as crevice corrosion.</p>

                                        <p>Microbial corrosion is caused by certain types of marine bacteria, which
                                            stick to the hull or accumulate in crevices. Their biological activity
                                            modifies local chemistry by acid production, thus accelerating corrosion.

                                        <p>Internal corrosion takes place in tanks, piping and pumping equipment in oil
                                            tankers. </p>

                                        <p> Structural weakening – Since stress-bearing components of ships are made
                                            of steel, any serious corrosion causes structural weakness, compromising
                                            safety – In stormy seas, ships’ hulls are subjected to much torsional
                                            stress, and normal-duty payload (e.g. ship cargo) also stresses the
                                            structure. A weakened structure will flex more, increasing fretting
                                            corrosion, and in turn further weakening the structure, as well as
                                            allowing the ingress of water and dirt through weakened seals or through
                                            welded/rivetted joints becoming porous, as explained below. And of
                                            course, a sufficiently weakened structure can catastrophically fail.</p>

                                        <p> Ingress of water and dirt causing more corrosion – Corrosion around
                                            openings, often caused by salt water trapped under rubber seals, weakens
                                            the effectiveness of these seals and allows water and dirt to enter
                                            enclosed areas. Those enclosed areas may have an intricate internal
                                            structure with many places where water and dirt can accumulate – usually
                                            invisible from the outside. The accumulated dirt forms a sponge which
                                            retains any water ingress, forming stagnant pools of salty water,
                                            causing further corrosion.</p>

                                        <p>Ingress of water causing electrical faults – The weakening of seals
                                            mentioned above can also cause water to enter electrical connection
                                            boxes and equipment, causing short circuits and the corrosion of
                                            electrical connections.</p>

                                        <p>Ingress of water causing flooding – Corrosion-weakened seals may cause
                                            ingress of enough water to destabilise the ship. Corrosion-weakened
                                            rivetted or welded joints (which may be below the water line) may become
                                            porous, allowing massive flooding.</p>

                                        <p>The principal part of the ship vulnerable to corrosion is the hull &
                                            superstructure, which are exposed to the elements 24 hours a day.</p>

                                            <h4>Engine Heat Exchangers</h4>

                                        <p>Marine engines are typically cooled by a coolant/antifreeze/anticorrosion
                                            mixture circulating in a closed circuit, similarly to modern motor vehicles.
                                            After passing through the engine, this mixture is cooled by heat-exchangers
                                            in which sea-water flows in open circuit (analogous to the motor-vehicle
                                            radiator). The sea-water side of the heat exchangers are prone to corrosion
                                            due to the salinity of the water and the accumulation of sea-borne debris
                                            which act as sponges causing stagnant salty humidity and thence crevice
                                            corrosion.</p>

                                        <p>Some ships, especially large cargo ships and oil tankers have ballast tanks,
                                            which are used to change the weight distribution of the ship, or to change
                                            its draft, in order to optimise stability. Ballast tanks being filled with
                                            water, often sea water, are very prone to corrosion.</p>
                                        <p> Ballast tanks do not corrode uniformly: The upper part, which forms an empty
                                            headspace, even when the tank is full, undergoes thermal cycling (due to
                                            ambient
                                            temperature changes), contains much oxygen and is affected by vibration –
                                            corrosion easily takes a foothold. The bottom part, which is often immersed
                                            in
                                            water is prone to the accumulation of marine microorganisms coming from the
                                            seawater pumped into the tanks. Also, when emptied, a thin and salty
                                            electro-conducting moisture film remains on the surface. Both of these
                                            phenomena
                                            cause corrosion.</p>

                                        <p>Modern double hull tankers, with fully segregated ballast tanks suffer from
                                            an
                                            additional vulnerability: An empty tank acts as insulation from the cold
                                            sea,
                                            allowing the warm cargo areas to retain their heat longer. Since corrosion
                                            rate
                                            increases with temperature differences, the cargo side of the ballast tank
                                            corrodes more quickly than it would in a conventional configuration.</p>

                                            <h4>Particular Vulnerabilities Of Oil Tankers</h4>
                                        </div>
                                        <p> Oil storage tanks in tankers are vulnerable to “sweet” and “sour” corrosion.
                                            Sweet corrosion takes place in systems containing only carbon dioxide, with
                                            a low level of hydrogen sulphide (H2S partial pressure < 0.05 psi). Sour
                                                corrosion takes place where the hydrogen sulphide’s partial pressure is
                                                above 0.05 psi. H2S itself is not corrosive, but a water-containing gas
                                                environment causes reactions which lead to corrosion of the inner
                                                surface of the steel pipeline.</p>

                                                <p>Sweet corrosion results in internal pitting of the pipeline, whereas
                                                    sour corrosion is much more severe, and can compromise the
                                                    structural soundness of the tank.</p>

                                                <p>In addition, moisture ingress, and its accumulation in the tank
                                                    bottom aggravates corrosion. This moisture may also evaporate in
                                                    warm weather, and with a fall of external temperature, re-condensate
                                                    all over the internal surface of the tank.</p>
